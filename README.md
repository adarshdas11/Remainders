# Remainders Project

## Overview
The Remainder project is a simple web application designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. It provides a clean and intuitive interface for adding, editing, and deleting tasks. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
1. **Add Task**: Users can add tasks by typing in the task description and hitting the enter key or clicking the add button.
2. **Edit Task**: Tasks can be edited inline by clicking on the task text. This allows users to update task details easily.
3. **Delete Task**: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking on the delete button associated with each task.
4. **Mark as Done**: Completed tasks can be marked by clicking a checkbox or by applying a strikethrough style to the task text.
5. **Local Storage**: The application stores tasks locally in the browser's storage, ensuring that tasks persist even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.
